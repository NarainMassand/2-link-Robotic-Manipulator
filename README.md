# 2-link-Robotic-Manipulator 
Simulating Kinematics and Dynamics of a 2 link Robotic arm using Path Planning and PID controller<br/>

Given the initial, the final and the waypoints, the aim is to plan the path for the robotic arm. The Path is defined by a set of points from which joint angles can be calculated using Inverse Kinematics.

An animation with dynamics is also included
